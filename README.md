# Boston-Airbnb-Data-Analysis

Detailed analysis of [Boston Airbnb data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston), along with home price prediction using linear regression. There is also a [blog post](https://medium.com/@ahmad_sherief/a-trip-to-boston-with-airbnb-and-some-data-science-22495270b43) that describes the findings of the analysis.

## Quick Start

There are 2 options available:

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/AhmadSherief/Boston-Airbnb-Data-Analysis.git`
- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/AhmadSherief/Boston-Airbnb-Data-Analysis/archive/master.zip)

## Project Motivation

The objective of this project is to analyse [Boston Airbnb data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston) in order to answer some intriguing questions that one might have. These questions are:

1. How much do areas, as well as time frames, influence AirBNB home earnings?
2. How can reviews affect the prices of AirBNB homes?
3. Does the internet availability affect the number of listings af an AirBNB home? and if so, should a host invest in making this service available for his listing?
4. What percentage of people look for an AirBNB home with a washer/dryer available? And how much more do they have to pay to get this service?
5. Can we use this data to predict the price of an AirBNB home?

## File Description

The file is written in a Jupyter Notebook, and follows the `CRISP-DM` process.

- First we state the questions that we need to answer.
- Next we explore the data.
- Then we perform some `Data wrangling` to gain insights in order to answer our questions.
- After that we model the data using a linear regression model to predict the price of an Airbnb home in Boston.
- Finally we summarize our findings.

## Usage

After you get the repo, you can play around with some column names in the `Boston Airbnb Data Analysis.ipynb` file to answer some of your own questions.

This can be done in the `Data Modeling and Evaluation` section in the file.
